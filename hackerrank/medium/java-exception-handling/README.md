# Java Exception Handling

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You are required to compute the power of a number by implementing a calculator. Create a class *MyCalculator* which consists of a single method `long power(int, int)`. This method takes two integers, $n$ and $p$, as parameters and finds $n^p$. If either $n$ or $p$ is negative, then the method must throw an exception which says "$\texttt{n or p should not be negative}$". Also, if both $n$ and $p$ are zero, then the method must throw an exception which says "$\texttt{n and p should not be zero.}$"

For example, *-4* and *-5* would result in $\texttt{java.lang.Exception: n or p should not be negative}$.

Complete the function `power` in class *MyCalculator* and return the appropriate result after the power operation or an appropriate exception as detailed above. 

**Input Format**

Each line of the input contains two integers, $n$ and $p$. The locked stub code in the editor reads the input and sends the values to the method as parameters.

**Constraints**

- $-10 \le n \le 10$
- $-10 \le p \le 10$

**Output Format**

Each line of the output contains the result $n^p$, if both $n$ and $p$ are positive. If either $n$ or $p$ is negative, the output contains "n and p should be non-negative". If 
both $n$ and $p$ are zero, the output contains "n and p should not be zero.". This is printed by the locked stub code in the editor.

```java

class MyCalculator {
    /*
    * Create the method long power(int, int) here.
    */
    
     public long power(int b, int p) throws Exception{
        
        long res = 1;
        
        if(b<0 || p<0)
          throw new Exception("n or p should not be negative.");
          
        if(b==0 && p==0)
          throw new Exception("n and p should not be zero.");
        
        for(int i=1; i<=p ;i++){
            res*=b;
        }
        return res;
     }
    
    
    
}


```
