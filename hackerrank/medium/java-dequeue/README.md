# Java Comparator

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

In computer science, a double-ended queue (dequeue, often abbreviated to deque, pronounced deck) is an abstract data type that generalizes a queue, for which elements can be added  to or removed from either the front (head) or back (tail).

    
Deque interfaces can be implemented using various types of collections such as `LinkedList` or `ArrayDeque` classes. For example, deque can be declared as:

    Deque deque = new LinkedList<>();
    or
    Deque deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
    
You can find more details about Deque [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html).

In this problem, you are given $N$ integers. You need to find the maximum number of unique integers among all the possible contiguous subarrays of size $M$.

*Note*: Time limit is $3$ second for this problem.


**Input Format**

The first line of input contains two integers $N$ and $M$: representing the total number of integers and the size of the subarray, respectively. The next line contains $N$ space separated integers. 

**Constraints**

$1 \le N \le 100000$<br>
$1 \le M \le 100000$<br>
$M\le N$<br>
The numbers in the array will range between $[0,10000000]$.


**Output Format**

Print the *maximum* number of unique integers among all possible contiguous subarrays of size $M$.

```java


// Write your Checker class here
class Checker implements Comparator<Player>{
    @Override
    public int compare(Player a , Player b) {
        
        if(a.score == b.score){  // if score is equal for both , [then sort according to lexicographically-order]
            int diff = (a.name).compareTo(b.name); // Sorting 2 string on the basis of lexicographically 
            return diff;
        }
        else{ // sort them in decreasing-order of score [which is an integer] 
            int diff = Integer.compare(b.score, a.score);
            return diff;
        }
  }
}

```
