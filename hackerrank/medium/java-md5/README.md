## Problem

*MD5* (*Message-Digest algorithm 5*) is a widely-used cryptographic hash function with a $128$-bit hash value. Here are some common uses for *MD5*:

* To store a one-way hash of a password.
* To provide some assurance that a transferred file has arrived intact. 

*MD5* is one in a series of message digest algorithms designed by Professor Ronald Rivest of MIT (Rivest, $1994$); however, the security of *MD5* has been severely compromised, most infamously by the Flame malware in $2012$. The *CMU Software Engineering Institute* essentially considers *MD5* to be ["cryptographically broken and unsuitable for further use"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5).

Given an alphanumeric string, $s$, denoting a password, compute and print its *MD5* encryption value.


**Input Format**

A single alphanumeric string denoting $s$. 

**Constraints**

* $ 6 \le |s| \le 20 $
- String $s$ consists of English alphabetic letters (i.e., $[a-zA-Z]$ and/or decimal digits (i.e., $0$ through $9$) only.

**Output Format**

Print the *MD5* encryption value of $s$ on a new line.

**Sample Input 0**

	HelloWorld
    
**Sample Output 0**

	68e109f0f40ca72a15e05cc22786f8e6
    
**Sample Input 1**

**Sample Output 1**

```java

class MyCalculator {
    /*
    * Create the method long power(int, int) here.
    */
    
     public long power(int b, int p) throws Exception{
        
        long res = 1;
        
        if(b<0 || p<0)
          throw new Exception("n or p should not be negative.");
          
        if(b==0 && p==0)
          throw new Exception("n and p should not be zero.");
        
        for(int i=1; i<=p ;i++){
            res*=b;
        }
        return res;
     }
    
    
    
}


```
